<p>Today while debugging my new Windows Phone 7 Application, I encountered an exception I had never seen before:<br />
<em><strong>"Value does not fall within the expected range."</strong></em><br />
To be precise, I encountered it here:</p>
<p><strong>SomeRandomDictionary["TheMightyKey"]="WeirdValue";</strong></p>
<p>I scratched my head, puzzled, cuz I knew this statement had executed before successfully. And then after some googling, I came to know this happens if you assign a Key value pair for some key that already exists in the dictionary.</p>
<p>You must be wondering why I am telling you this story, and why the heck am I not posting the solution, the answer is simple:</p>
<p>It makes me feel like The Wise One. AND its my blog, I can do whatever I want ;)</p>
<p>Anyway, coming to the solution, you can simply resolve this by checking if a key already exists and removing it if it does before assigning a new KeyValuePair.</p>
<p><strong>if(SomeRandomDictionary.Contains("TheMightyKey"))</p>
<p>SomeRandomDictionary.Remove("TheMightyKey");</p>
<p>SomerandomDictionary["TheMightyKey"]="Weird Value";</strong></p>
<p>There you go, now you probably wont ever see this exception again.</p>
<p>Happy Coding.</p>
