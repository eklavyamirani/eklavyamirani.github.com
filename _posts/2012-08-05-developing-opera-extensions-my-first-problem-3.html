<p>Last night I wrote a post about my experience developing my first extension for Opera, and everything went pretty smooth.</p>
<p>Today, I faced a new problem, I changed my code because it was breaking down the internal working of the websites (e.g. the mighty Youtube, and MSDN login.)</p>
<p>The bugs seem to be:</p>
<p>"A package with this name already exists. Please change the name or upgrade the existing package."</p>
<p>Apparently, there seems to be a bug that doesn't delete files from the server, yet shows me that I successfully deleted the extension.</p>
<p>I posted a new topic on dev.opera.com forums, and hopefully this will be fixed soon.</p>
