<p><strong>Objective: To develop a system that recognizes the gestures made in front of a camera and transform them into human readable form as images.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Background: Hand as a tool in communication.</strong></p>
<p>Hand gestures are an important part of communication amongst people. Often we find ourselves talking to one another, using our hands to explain our point in a better way.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine the following scenarios:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>You come around a thought and use your hands to make mental notes of the idea. You think logically, your hands work as if writing something in air.</em></li>
<li><em>A kid drawing or writing something on a moisturized part of a glass, or a dust laden glass.</em></li>
<li><em>You are trying to convey a message to a person standing on the other corner of a crowded room where he cannot listen to your voice. You communicate with the help of gestures,and make it as understandable as possible.</em></li>
<li><em>You are playing a game of “Dumb Charades,” you are given a movie to describe to your team, you use your hands to make it as understandable as possible.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>All these scenarios explain how hands form an essential tool for communication. Hand gestures form an essential part of communication and provide semantic meaning to what the speaker has to say.</p>
<p><strong>How this system would be beneficial to its users?</strong></p>
<p>Using the gesture recognition system, one would have the ability to actually draw in air, and convert the drawing into a human readable image, which can be recorded for later reference, and shared with others.</p>
<p>This system could be a vital to bridge the language barrier amongst people of different ethnicities that don’t share a common language.  </p>
<p>This system could also be used for making notes and reminders quickly while reducing the use of papers, and keeping them organized.</p>
<p>It will also pave the path for making digital communication simpler, and user friendly, and easier to adapt by people that are accustomed to the conventional form of written communication.</p>
