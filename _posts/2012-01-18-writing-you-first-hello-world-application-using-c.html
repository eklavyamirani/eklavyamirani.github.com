<p>Hey,</p>
<p>This post will give you a simple tutorial on how to write a simple "Hello World" application using C#.</p>
<p>To start programming with C#, you need a compiler that can compile the code into the machine language that the computer can understand.</p>
<p>Anyway, getting to the point, in this article I will explain how to write your simple hello world console application using C#.</p>
<p>Here's what you need:<br />
Visual Studio 2008/2010 Express(freely available) or higher<br />
or MonoDevelop<br />
or #Develop (SharpDevelop)</p>
<p>All of the above three tools are freely available on the internet and in case you have trouble looking for it, try asking your friend Google for help.</p>
<p>Now that we have the tool to get started, lets start:</p>
<blockquote><p>using System;</p>
<p>namespace MyFirstCSProgram</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>class MyFirstCSProgram</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>static void Main(string[] args)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>//Prints whatever is passed to it on the console.</p>
<p>Console.WriteLine("Hello World, This is Eklavya!");</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>There you go, a very simple "Hello World" console app is ready!</p></blockquote>
