<p>Everytime I see a link someone posts without the anchor tag, I, being the lazy one, always wonder if it is possible to make that link clickable. Obviously, if a link is posted, it ought to be clicked. Does the author assume we, "The lazy ones" would actually copy paste the entire thing, open a new tab, paste the link and hit enter and get back to the old page the link was opened from and complete reading it?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes, that link must be pointing to one heck of a page that moves my world, or else it might subtly, very subtly, enter my list of, what I call, "Links I can do without."</p>
<p>Lemme show you what I mean.</p>
<p>http://www.google.com</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com">http://www.google.com</a></p>
<p>Which one is better? I prefer the one that is clickable, I'd middle click on it and send it to a background tab in my Opera.</p>
<p>So, today I finally completed the first version of my Opera Extension, LinkMoi. What does it do? It makes the non-clickable links/Uri clickable. And if you visit phpBB forums, this might be your lucky day. Most of them have a common rule, "all links must be coded." Well, these links aren't clickable-just coded, so if you want to open it select it (or click 'select all') and add it to the address bar.</p>
<p>With LinkMoi, the link becomes clickable, just click and open. Simple.<br />
(I know Linkify was developed for this, and it has been there for a while...My intention was to implement one myself.)</p>
<p>I wrote a simple javascript to convert all the urls to clickable links, this wasn't hard. I created a button, whose onclick event calls the function that does this job.</p>
<p>Click, and BINGO! Click again and.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
WTF!<br />
http://www.google.com becomes http://www.google.com"&gt;http://www.google.com.</p>
<p>and I click again.. WTF!x2<br />
http://www.google.com"&gt;http://www.google.com becomes http://www.google.com"&gt;http://www.google.com"&gt;http://www.google.com.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, href="http://www.google.com" also gets converted. I will not go into my trials and errors, certainly, <em>I don't really enjoy talking about my mistakes :)</em> What I did was to skip those links that followed '&gt;' symbol. Genius, eh? (Hang on, read the next few lines before answering that.)</p>
<p>Once I fixed it, I copied the source of a website I use often and used it in my test page.<em> Didn't work.</em> Check the source and found, the link was wrapped around the 'span' tag.</p>
<p>So much for a genius thought!</p>
<p>I tried catching the '"' along with the link (using ["]? regex) and skip the link which was contained in '"' as they are the ones causing troubles. So, I had to skip a few links in the regex search, as every href="http://..."&gt; lead to 3 false results:</p>
<p>href=<strong>"http://...</strong>"&gt;http://<br />
href="<strong>http://...</strong>"&gt;http://<br />
href="http://..."&gt;<strong>http://</strong></p>
<p>So, I skipped 3 links. Worked.<em> Excellent job, I said to myself.</em></p>
<p>So I made the extension, zipped and renamed it to LinkMoi.oex and began testing. I found out that some links were being skipped, and the header of a page showed a 'url' it wasn't supposed to.</p>
<p>I digged a little deeper, looked at the source. What I found did another damage to my "Geniusness." Links were also present as part of the images and in that case I recieved only 2 false positives:</p>
<p>src=<strong>"http://</strong>"&gt;<br />
src="<strong>http://</strong>"&gt;</p>
<p>So skipping 3 meant I certainly was missing a few links.<br />
<em>Darn!</em></p>
<p>To fix it, I took a piece of paper and pen, and actually wrote down the possible ways in which links could be posted in a website, between <em>'span', in 'src', in 'href', as 'url', 'action',</em> etc. So I checked the 9 character substring preceding the link and checked for these keywords, if found skip the links accordingly. And as a default check anything which has '=' in the last two characters is skipped.</p>
<p>Bingo! Works. Checked on a few phpBB forums, MSDN, wordpress and everything works just fine.</p>
<p>So here it is, my first experience developing an Opera Extension. Here's the link to the extension: <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/linkmoi/?display=en">https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/linkmoi/?display=en</a></p>
