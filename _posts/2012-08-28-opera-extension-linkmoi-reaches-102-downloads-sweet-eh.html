<p>In two of my previous articles I described my experience developing my first Opera Extension LinkMoi, and I am now proud to say, LinkMoi has reached its first landmark, 100+downloads.</p>
<p>I do admit there were a few bugs in the initial result, but it was all Javascript's fault, I swear I had nothing to do with it. ;)</p>
<p>The first released version, broke the javascript on a few pages such as http://play.google.com (You know you need my extension if you are too lazy to copy paste this link ;) ).</p>
<p>So after trying to fix the bug after 6 hours of hit and trial debugging, I finally released a stable version which has been accepted by Opera and is now listed on http://addons.opera.com.</p>
<p>You can download my extension here:</p>
<p><a href="https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/linkmoi/?display=en">https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/linkmoi/?display=en</a></p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>This is just a stable initial release, and there is a lot more to come, such as support for other protocols, link preferences, link preview, etc.</p>
<p>So hold your breath (not literally ofc), because the next version will be a major upgrade.</p>
